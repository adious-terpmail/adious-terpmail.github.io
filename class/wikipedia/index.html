            Mahomes spent his rookie season as the backup to Alex Smith. He was named the starter in 2018 after the Chiefs traded Smith to the Washington Redskins. That season, Mahomes threw for 5,097 yards, 50 touchdowns, and 12 interceptions. He became the only quarterback in history to throw for more than 5,000 yards in a single season in both college and in the NFL. He joined Peyton Manning as the only player in NFL history to throw 50 touchdown passes and 5,000 yards in a single season.[7] For his performance in his first season as starter, he was named to the Pro Bowl, named First Team All-Pro, and won the NFL Offensive Player of the Year and NFL Most Valuable Player awards. Mahomes is one of four black quarterbacks to win the AP MVP award.[a][8]

         In the 2019 season, Mahomes led the Chiefs to Super Bowl LIV, their first Super Bowl appearance in 50 years, where they defeated the San Francisco 49ers.[9] Mahomes was awarded the Super Bowl MVP for his performance, the second black quarterback and youngest overall to do so.[b][10] He is also the third African American quarterback to win a Super Bowl.[c] In 2020, Mahomes signed a 10-year contract extension worth $477 million with another $26 million in potential bonuses, for a total of $503 million, making it the third-largest known contract in sporting history.[12][13] The year after signing his contract, he would lead the Chiefs to their second consecutive Super Bowl, but the team lost to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. In the 2022 season, Mahomes won his second career NFL MVP and his second Super Bowl MVP in Super Bowl LVII over the Philadelphia Eagles, becoming the first player to win NFL MVP and Super Bowl MVP in the same year since 1999, along with joining Tom Brady and Joe Montana as the only quarterbacks to win multiple regular season and Super Bowl MVPs.

    Since becoming the Chiefs' starting quarterback, Mahomes has led the team to five consecutive AFC Championship Game appearances from the 2018 season through the 2022 season, which is tied for second place with Ken Stabler for the most consecutive conference championship game appearances by a quarterback.
