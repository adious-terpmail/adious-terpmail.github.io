      <h2>Major</h2>
      <img src="images/journalism.webp">
      <p>My major is Journalism. Since I was 15 years old, I wanted to be a journalist because of my passion for sports and talk television. ESPN's televsion shows, First Take and sportscenter inspired me into wanting to become a Journalist because I love arguing with people about sports. Everyday I watch and talk about sports to my friends and family like its a job, but really it's just something that I'm passionate about. When I learned that I could make a career out of it, thats when the lightbulb went on and immediately knew what I wanted to do in the future. Journalism requires good writing and communication skills.</p>

        <p>My dream is to get hired by ESPN. I love talking sports and believe ESPN is the king of all things sports television. Everything I learned and loved about sports came from watching ESPN sponsored games and shows.</p>
