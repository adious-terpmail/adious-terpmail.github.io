        <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1/2 cup chopped onion</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons minced garlic</li>
        <li>1/4 cup fresh cilantro</li>
        <li>1/2  teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon chipotle chile in adobo sauce</li>
        <li>11/2 cup white rice</li>
        <li>2 (15-ounce) cans chicken broth, low-sodium preferred</li>
        <li>2 (11-ounce) cans Southwest Mix vegetables with black beans, corn, and peppers ilantro sprigs, for garnish</li>
    </ul> 

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
       <li>Pound the chicken breasts until they are 1/2-inch thick and cut into thirds crosswise.</li> 
        <li>In a large, deep nonstick skillet, heat the vegetable oil over medium-high heat. Add the chicken and cook for about 3 minutes per side until golden brown. Transfer to a plate and set aside.</li>
        <li>In the same skillet, cook the onion, stirring often, until it becomes translucent, about 3 minutes. Add the garlic, cilantro, salt, and cumin and stir over heat for an additional minute. Add the hipotle chile to the sauce and then the rice. Cook, stirring, until the rice begins to turn translucent, about 3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Return the chicken to the pan, add the broth, and bring to a boil. Lower the heat to medium-low, cover, and cook until the liquid has been absorbed and the rice is nearly cooked, about 20 minutes. Remove the cover, add the Southwest Mix vegetables to the pan, and cook for an additional 10 minutes until heated through.</li>
        <li>Garnish with cilantro and serve.</li>
    </ol>
